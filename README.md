- 👋 Hi, I’m @contovigario
- 👀 I’m interested in music production, Max for Live, smart contracts and building strange controllers in Arduino for Ableton.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell as a roadmap to Smart Contracts. I'm also training my Node+React stack skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music production software like VSTs but I'm always ready to hear a pitch :)
